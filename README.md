# 🔐 Python Login System

A clean and beginner-friendly **terminal-based login system** built using Python.  
This project demonstrates basic authentication logic by validating a user’s **name, password, and email** against predefined admin credentials.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Admin authentication using:
  - Username
  - Password
  - Email
- Clear success and failure responses
- Structured and readable Python code
- Uses functions and constants (good coding practice)
- No external libraries required

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter:
   - Name
   - Password
   - Email
2. The input values are compared with stored admin credentials.
3. If all credentials match:
   - Access is granted
4. Otherwise:
   - Access is denied
